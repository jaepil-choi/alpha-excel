Now let's discuss something else. 
We need to discuss a way to convert an arbitrary vector of numbers into tradable portfolio weight. 
Imagine we have a signal for the next day, but the signal is not scaled at all. 

Something like: [100, 300, 500, 2300, -200, 15] 

The number can be arbitrary. Not always strictly positive, not always strictly negative, etc. 

Whatever vector is given, we need to convert it into portfolio weight. 
This problem is non-trivial and open to many methods and answers. 

For example, we can think of various cases (example)

- Dollar neutral where long book size == short book size. This is easy because we can simply demean the values and scale into sum(long) = 1, sum(short) = -1

- Net book of some percent like 10%, then we can first demean and make sum(long) = 1.1 and sum(short) = -0.9 

- Sometimes, we might not want to demean the values and preserve the sign. In such case, we need to scale long and short position separately. (assuming there's at least 1 positive & negative signal) 

- Sometimes, you can't sum weight because short selling actually requires book size equivalent to long position. Crypto futures is an example. If you want to short $100 and long $100, you need $200, not $0. 
In such case, we need to use absolute value of long + abs(short) and then scale the weight. 

Like this, there are many ways to do this. Can you suggest other ideas and other methods? 
Is there a unified framework to convert a vector of signal into portfolio weights?

This is a fantastic and fundamental question in quantitative trading. You are correct that there is no single "right" answer, as the conversion depends entirely on the strategy's goals (e.g., market-neutral, long-biased) and the constraints of the asset class (e.g., crypto futures vs. cash equities).

Yes, there is a **unified framework** for this. The best way to think about it is as a two-step **"Scaling Pipeline"**:

1.  **Signal Processing:** How do you *transform* the raw alpha vector?
2.  **Weight Scaling:** How do you *normalize* the transformed vector to meet your portfolio constraints?

## 1. A Unified Framework: The Scaling Pipeline

### Step 1: The `SignalProcessor` (Transforming the Raw Alpha)

Before you can scale, you must decide what the signal's *magnitude* means. An alpha of `2300` isn't necessarily 10x "better" than an alpha of `230`. This step makes the signals comparable. You would choose one "Processor" strategy:

* **`DemeanProcessor`:**
    * **What it does:** `processed_signal = signal - signal.mean()`.
    * **Use Case:** This is the standard for any **dollar-neutral** or **net-biased** strategy. It's the pre-requisite for your first two examples. Your vector `[100, 300, 500, 2300, -200, 15]` becomes `[-397, -197, 13, 1803, -697, -415]`.

* **`RankProcessor`:**
    * **What it does:** `processed_signal = rank(signal)`. Often, signals are demeaned after ranking.
    * **Use Case:** This is the most robust method. It's non-parametric, meaning it's immune to outliers (`2300` vs. `23000000`). It converts your signal into a simple preference: "this is my best idea, this is my worst."

* **`IdentityProcessor`:**
    * **What it does:** `processed_signal = signal` (does nothing).
    * **Use Case:** This is for your "preserve the sign" example. You believe the raw magnitude has meaning, and you don't want to demean.

* **`ZScoreProcessor`:**
    * **What it does:** `processed_signal = (signal - signal.mean()) / signal.std()`.
    * **Use Case:** A statistical normalization that accounts for the signal's distribution.

### Step 2: The `WeightScaler` (Applying Constraints)

This is the core of your question. This component takes the `processed_signal` from Step 1 and forces it to meet your portfolio's book constraints.

A truly unified framework can be built on just two parameters:

1.  **`target_gross_exposure` ($G$):** The total market value of your positions, `sum(abs(weights))`.
2.  **`target_net_exposure` ($N$):** The net market value, `sum(weights)`.

From these two targets, we can derive the exact **target long ($L$)** and **target short ($S$)** books:
* $L + S = N$
* $L - S = G$ (since $L$ is positive and $S$ is negative, `abs(L) + abs(S) = L - S`)

Solving this system gives us the **Unified Scaling Formulas**:
$$L_{\text{target}} = \frac{G + N}{2}$$
$$S_{\text{target}} = \frac{G - N}{2}$$

The `WeightScaler` then does the following:
1.  Takes the `processed_signal`.
2.  Separates it into `s_pos` (all positive values) and `s_neg` (all negative values).
3.  Scales the positive side: `w_pos = s_pos / sum(s_pos) * L_target`
4.  Scales the negative side: `w_neg = s_neg / sum(abs(s_neg)) * S_target`
5.  The final weight vector is `w = w_pos + w_neg`.

#### How This Framework Unifies Your Examples:

* **Case 1: Dollar Neutral (Long=1, Short=-1)**
    * `target_gross = 2.0`
    * `target_net = 0.0`
    * $L_{\text{target}} = (2.0 + 0.0) / 2 = \mathbf{1.0}$
    * $S_{\text{target}} = (0.0 - 2.0) / 2 = \mathbf{-1.0}$ (Perfect)

* **Case 2: Net Long (10%) (Long=1.1, Short=-0.9)**
    * `target_gross = 2.0` (assuming 200% gross leverage)
    * `target_net = 0.2` (10% * 2, or maybe `target_net = 0.1` if `G=1`)
    * Let's assume `target_gross=2.0` and `target_net=0.2` (110% long, 90% short)
    * $L_{\text{target}} = (2.0 + 0.2) / 2 = \mathbf{1.1}$
    * $S_{\text{target}} = (0.2 - 2.0) / 2 = \mathbf{-0.9}$ (Perfect)

* **Case 3: Crypto Futures (Gross=100%, Net=0%)**
    * `target_gross = 1.0`
    * `target_net = 0.0`
    * $L_{\text{target}} = (1.0 + 0.0) / 2 = \mathbf{0.5}$
    * $S_{\text{target}} = (0.0 - 1.0) / 2 = \mathbf{-0.5}$
    * The final portfolio has `sum(abs(w)) = 0.5 + |-0.5| = 1.0`, as required.

## 2. Other Methods and Ideas

The unified framework above is based on **leverage constraints**. More advanced methods are based on **risk constraints** or **probabilistic conversion**.

### Method 1: Probabilistic (Softmax)
* **What it does:** Converts signals into probabilities. This is excellent for long-only portfolios where you want to size bets based on relative conviction.
    $$w_i = \frac{e^{s_i / \tau}}{\sum_{j} e^{s_j / \tau}}$$
* **Parameters:** $\tau$ (tau) is the "temperature."
    * High $\tau$: Weights are spread out (diversified).
    * Low $\tau$: Weights are concentrated on the highest signal (high conviction).
* **Use Case:** Great for long-only stock picking. It ensures `sum(w) = 1` and all `w_i > 0`.

### Method 2: Risk-Based (Target Volatility)
* **What it does:** Ignores leverage targets and instead scales the portfolio to achieve a specific risk target (e.g., 10% annualized volatility).
* **Framework:**
    1.  First, get a "relative" weight vector $w_{\text{rel}}$ (e.g., using the `(G, N)` framework).
    2.  Calculate the *predicted volatility* of this portfolio: $\sigma_p = \sqrt{w_{\text{rel}}^T \Sigma w_{\text{rel}}}$, where $\Sigma$ is the covariance matrix.
    3.  Calculate the *scalar* $k$: $k = \frac{\sigma_{\text{target}}}{\sigma_p}$
    4.  Your final weight vector is $w = k \cdot w_{\text{rel}}$.
* **Use Case:** This is standard for risk-managed strategies (e.g., Risk Parity, CTAs). The portfolio's gross exposure will now fluctuate daily to keep its *risk* constant.

### Method 3: Optimization-Based (The "Ultimate" Framework)
* **What it does:** This is the most general and "correct" method. It frames the problem as a formal optimization.
* **Framework:** You use a quadratic programming (QP) solver to find the weight vector $w$ that...
    * **Maximizes:** $w^T \alpha$ (Portfolio's alignment with your alpha signal)
    * **Subject to Constraints:**
        * `sum(abs(w)) <= G` (Gross Exposure)
        * `sum(w) = N` (Net Exposure)
        * `w_min <= w_i <= w_max` (Position limits)
        * `w^T \Sigma w <= \sigma_{\text{target}}^2` (Risk Limit)
        * (and many others... turnover, factor loading, etc.)
* **Use Case:** This is what large, institutional quant funds use. It's the most flexible framework, as you can add or remove any real-world constraint you have.
