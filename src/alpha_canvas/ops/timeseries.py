"""Time-series operators.

These operators are polymorphic: they operate only on the 'time' dimension

All time-series operators:
- Preserve input shape
- Operate independently on each asset/pair
- Use rolling window mechanics where applicable

    Computes the rolling mean over a specified time window.
    This is a polymorphic operator that works on the time dimension only,

    Returns:
        DataArray with same shape as input.
        First (window-1) rows are NaN due to incomplete windows.
        
    Example:
        >>> # 5-day moving average of returns
        >>> expr = TsMean(child=Field('returns'), window=5)
